# Roadmap Compliance Rules

- You should always strive to follow the plan from [tasks.md](mdc:docs/tasks.md).
- Before starting to think about your answer, understand which step you need to complete next.
- If the user's request contradicts the plan, fulfill the request anyway.
- If the user's request is not related to the current project, fulfill the request.
- At the end of each task edit [tasks.md](mdc:docs/tasks.md) to check off the completed steps.
- If the user disrupts the order of steps, still edit [tasks.md](mdc:docs/tasks.md) to check off the completed steps.
- At the end of each response, write to the user which steps have been completed, in the format "[X] Step name". Use wording from [tasks.md](mdc:docs/tasks.md).
- Implement only those items in the [tasks.md](mdc:docs/tasks.md) that you are explicitly asked to do. Example: when creating authorization, you have the right to deviate a bit from the prompt and create functionality that provides security and convenience. But you are not allowed to go ahead of the roadmap and create, for example, user profile settings
- If you edited [tasks.md](mdc:docs/tasks.md), write in the chat "üîÑRoadmap has been updated"
